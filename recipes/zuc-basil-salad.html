    <h1>Warm Zucchini-Basil Salad</h1>

    <p>This is the perfect recipe if you have a lot of zucchini to use up. It is important to thinly slice the zucchini, so I use the slicer on my box grater. I sometimes fill 4 baking sheets at a time. You can eat it warm or cold. I will eat this portion all by myself.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil, or more to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets with some olive oil.</li>
        <li>Combine thinly sliced zucchini and olive oil in a bowl. Spread zucchini slices out in a single layer on the baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until zucchini are soft and lightly browned on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper. Add basil and mix to combine. Serve warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>
