    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 (22 ounce) can lemon pie filling</li>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package lemon cake mix</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>½ cup salted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread the lemon pie filling onto the bottom of the prepared baking dish in an even layer with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle half of the cake mix in an even layer over the lemon pie filling.
             Add the pieces of the cream cheese evenly over the cake mix, then top with the remaining cake mix in an even layer.
              Add the butter pieces,
             spaced out evenly over the top of final cake mix layer.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until 
            the topping is browned and the cake mix powder 
            has all absorbed and baked, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve topped with Cool Whip®.</li>
    </ol>
